In acknowledgment of Oxfords largely pedestrianised nature I've increased the width of edges not open to vehicular traffic as they are prolific in the central area. The given point value is an area centered on a core section of the high street. The image itself is rendered in accordance with the paradigms set prior with with the height and width given as the aforementioned 240 size value, to give a square plot."

    "This final interactive map displays both the nodes and edges simultaneously while also visualising the betweenness_centrality for each of node. Use of the 'set_node_attributes' allows for the visualisation of a tertiary variable on the spatial plane. Both edges and nodes are set to true ensuring both are visualised while in this instance I've gone ahead and changed the tileset to the dark counterpart as it allows for easier for greater contrast with the high betweeness_centrality values allowing for an immediate distinction to be drawn. As hypothesised above, the higher betweeness centrality values are agglomerated toward a central location upon which many of the radial edges converge. Additionally more peripheral nodes which occupy key points of convergance hold rather high values. One could see how analysis like this could be of paramount importance for transport planners especcially when considering road byelaws or routeway alterations."
